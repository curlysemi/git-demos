# Git Demos

This repo contains branches used in the demos of the presentation 'Git & U.' All the commands used for each demo will be reproduced in this README.

This repo is technically a fork of the [python adventure](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/python-adventure) project. The changes made in each "dev" branch are miniscule and somewhat pointless, but they make for a more entertaining demo amongst ~~nerds~~ programmers.
